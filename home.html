        In this project for CSCI 1300: User Interfaces and User Experience, we were asked to observe 
        real users interacting with a simple interface, interview these individuals about their 
        experiences, and create Personas based on them. I chose the CVS self-checkout machine as my
        interface.

        CVS Pharmacies have self-checkout machines for users who want to avoid long lines when paying
        and, during the COVID pandemic, to help people keep their distance. The self-checkout machine
        consists of a touch screen that walks the user through the steps for scanning and paying for 
        their items, a barcode scanner, a bagging area, a scale to place items after scanning, and a 
        payment machine.

        Of the three Brown students I observed, two experienced some minor complications when using 
        the self-checkout machine. The machine had troubles processing an item purchased by the 
        first user, so an employee had to come to assist. The second user inserted a credit card 
        before time, so the machine took a while to process the payment. The users verbally expressed 
        their unsatisfaction with the extended checkout process. The other user was able to use the 
        machine effectively, seeming to know exactly what to do in each step and using it without 
        complications.

        The interviewed users prefer to use the self-checkout machine because most of the time, it is faster than 
        going to the cashier, it is more private, and they don’t have to interact with anyone else. They usually 
        have a pleasant experience using these interface, although sometimes it has glitches and 
        requires assistance from an employee. Their ideal checkout machine would scan all items properly, read 
        their cards immediately, and have the option to select “No receipt.”

        Is a sophomore at Brown. He likes studying
        during the day to see his friends at night. Cris likes efficiency but doesn't get stressed easily 
        if things don't go his way. He normally uses the self-checkout machine in CVS to skip the line. 
        Now, he's finishing the checkout process by pressing "Proceed to Pay", but he is confused on which 
        buttons to press because both the payment machine and the touch screen are
        waiting for a response. As many frequent users of the self-checkout machine, Cris navigates the 
        interface with ease but gets a little confused when it comes to paying. He also doesn't grab 
        the receipt and would prefer if the machine didn't print them.

        Is a Brown University junior taking 5 classes. She always wants to do things as fast
        as possible to be able to keep up with her busy lifestyle. Roberta uses the self-checkout machine
        to save time and go back to work ASAP. She's trying to checkout as fast as possible, so she keeps
        pressing the buttons without thinking too much. She rushes to insert her credit card before the 
        machine was ready, so she had to go back to the touch screen until the machine was ready for paying.
        As many users of the self-checkout machine, Roberta wants to make the process as efficient as possible,
        but making little mistakes can actually make the process longer.

    <div class="paragraph">
      Throughout these observations and interviews, I was able to get a better understanding of some students'
      general feelings towards the self-checkout process at CVS. These users prefer to do their own checkout,
      although sometimes the machines have glitches that can complicate or extend the process. It was helpful
      to design mental maps to better engage with the users feelings and reactions to certain circumstances.
